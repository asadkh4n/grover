# Grover Automation Task

### Get started:

1. Run command: npm install
2. To run : 
    - Sort feature on Chrome: 
      > npm run test:sortChrome
    - Sort feature on Firefox:
      > npm run test:sortMozilla
    
### Note: You can also run the command "node_modules/.bin/cypress open" inside the project foler, this will open the Cypress UI where you can click on the feature files that you wish to run.

3. You can set custom run commands in package.json
4. You can see the test reports in mochawesome-report folder once the test run is completed
5. Screenshots for failed tests can be found in screenshots and also the videos in videos folder.

### I left 2 test cases to fail so that you can see the debugging capabilites of Cypress in action. Each step in the test is run in a numbered list and you can easily identify where things went wrong and easily find the errors.
